        <p>This page is designed to keep track of my projects, and show my progress. This page is not currently styled, it is just so that I can record the order projects that I have completed so I don't forget. Page style/layout an resume info will be added at a later date.</p>

            </a>
            <p>This was the first app I ever created. I was just starting to learn React, and I felt I needed to apply what I was learning to an actual project. I wanted to see how the code could come together and create a working app. I also needed to convert recipes I had from a weight to volume, and I was not able to find an app that did what I needed online. I took this opportunity to create my own.</p>

            <!-- </a> -->
            <p>This was one of the first projects done during week on. It requires running 'npm start', so I need to figure out how to run it with gh-pages. There is currently now link to the websit where this app it.</p>

          </a>
          <p>Whack A Mole was an individual project. It was good for practicing selecting and manipulating elements on the DOM</p>

          </a>
          <p>This was the final and largest project for week one. It help me learn how to break up a large project into smaller, more managable tasks. (Still need to rewrite using 'this' and 'bind'.</p>
