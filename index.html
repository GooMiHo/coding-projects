            <p>This was the first app I ever created. I was just starting to learn React, and I felt I needed to apply what I was learning to an actual project. I wanted to see how the code could come together and create a working app. I also needed to convert recipes I had from a weight to volume, and I was not able to find an app that did what I needed online. I took this opportunity to create my own.</p>
